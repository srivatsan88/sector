1. Impact of Rising Sea Levels
Climate change leads to rising sea levels as polar ice melts, which directly impacts coastal communities by increasing the frequency and severity of flooding.

1.1 Key Risks
Increased Flooding: Higher sea levels mean that coastal areas are more prone to flooding, particularly during storms.
Coastal Erosion: Warmer ocean temperatures accelerate coastal erosion, reducing land area and threatening buildings near shorelines.

Topic: Climate Change and Its Impact on Oceans

Climate change has far-reaching impacts on the oceans, particularly affecting coastal areas and marine ecosystems. Due to rising global temperatures, polar ice caps are melting at an accelerated rate, causing sea levels to rise. This rise in sea levels increases the risk of flooding for coastal communities, especially during extreme weather events. Additionally, warmer ocean temperatures contribute to coastal erosion, which gradually reduces landmass and threatens infrastructure along shorelines. These impacts highlight the vulnerability of coastal regions and the need for adaptive measures to protect these areas.
